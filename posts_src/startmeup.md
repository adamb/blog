# Start Me Up:  Build a new blog
## 2025-06-02 15:54:56

I keep coming up with things I want to write up but don't really have a place to put them.  I tried using Hugo for a while and did't like it.  Back in 2007 I was using Blogger and that just seems way too old.

I'm rolling my own now.  Using HTMX and a little javascript and hosting it at Cloudflare.  This seems like the right thing and it fits my brain.  Let's see how it goes.
