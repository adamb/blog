# Libby: The Library App That Changed How I Read

I've been using the [Libby app](https://libbyapp.com/) by OverDrive for a many years now, and it's honestly revolutionized how I consume books. If you're not familiar with it, Libby connects you to your local library's digital collection - ebooks, audiobooks, magazines - all free with your library card.

## The Magic of Multiple Library Cards

Here's where it gets interesting: you can add multiple library cards to the same Libby account. I have cards from several library systems, which dramatically expands my available catalog. Some libraries have better tech book collections, others excel at fiction, and some have shorter wait times for popular titles.

**Pro tip**: Many libraries allow non-residents to get digital-only cards for a small annual fee. The Brooklyn Public Library, for example, offers this for around $50/year and has an excellent collection.

## It's all about the Kindle

I read books almost exclusively on my Kindle.  In the Libby app when you check out a book, there almost always is a button that says _send to Kindle_ or something similar.  This redirects you to the Amazon site where you can send the library book to your Kindle.

After the loan is over or you return the book, it will be automatically removed from your kindle.  

**Pro tip**: Put your Kindle in Airplane mode and the book will stay there even after it's returned.  Of course this means the sync won't work either, so you can't add new books unless you turn off Airplane mode.  Generally I download a few books and the keep the Kindle in airplane mode until I'm done with those books. 

Also, I use my kids library cards.  They don't use them and so I get to add two more libraries to my list.  Happy Father's Day to me! 

## Slightly Complicated UI/UX
The app has gotten slicker over the years.  I still find the UI confusing when searching for books. You can connect to multiple libraries and I always seem to have trouble switching libraries in the app.

But, when you search and find a book you want to check out, it will often send you to the library with the shortest wait time, which is great.  



## Current Limitations

- **Wait times**: Popular new releases can have holds measured in months
- **Limited simultaneous loans**: Most libraries cap you 3 items at once (I'm looking at you NYPL)
- **Platform restrictions**: You can't easily export highlights or notes
- **Geographic restrictions**: Some libraries are only available to residents


## Why This Matters

Libby represents something bigger than just "free books." It's a reminder that public libraries are quietly becoming some of our best digital infrastructure. While we debate streaming service costs and subscription fatigue, libraries are out here providing world-class digital experiences funded by the community, for the community.

If you haven't tried Libby yet, download it and get your library card connected. You might rediscover why libraries are one of humanity's best ideas.
