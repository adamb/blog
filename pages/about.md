Hey, I’m Adam — programmer, entrepreneur, investor, teacher, tinkerer, and someone who’s always hunting for the edge.

This blog is where I document what I’m building, breaking, and learning — from coding experiments and infrastructure hacks to travel adventures and the occasional philosophical detour. If I can automate it, optimize it, or repurpose it in a clever way, you’ll probably find something about it here.

I split my time between Puerto Rico and wherever curiosity takes me — sometimes it’s a new API or AI model, sometimes a jungle trek or a SpaceX launch. I’m into longevity, quantified living, and understanding how systems (both human and digital) tick. I run a coding school in San Juan that trains underrepresented engineers and helps them find high-leverage work.  I also run a small finca by the sea in Rio Grande where I live with my amazing wife, our dogs, and our chickens.  

You’ll find posts here on:

- Cloudflare, Svelte, HTMX, and AI-powered web apps  
- Real estate and tax strategies  
- Biohacking, travel, and offbeat tech  
- Side projects that may or may not go anywhere  
- Glitches in the Matrix  

I wrote a book called [Silicon Valley Stories](https://www.amazon.com/Silicon-Valley-Stories-sampler-startups-ebook/dp/B086YP97DS/) — a collection of startup tales and tech industry observations.

This is part lab notebook, part public experiment. I don’t write for SEO — I write for myself, and for the kind of curious, slightly obsessive people I’d want to grab coffee with.

If that’s you, welcome.
