<p>We bought our place in Condado, San Juan back in early 2017 and spent a few months doing a complete gut renovation. When we bought the place it had been renovated, but sadly, it had not been up to our standards, so we needed to tear out everything except the new tile, which we liked.</p>
<p>The previous owner had enclosed the balcony for some extra living space.  We decided we wanted to return it to an open air balcony since the balcony had excellent views of the ocean.</p>
<h1>Tesla Charging</h1>
<p>The one contingency we had when purchasing the unit was that the board gave us approval to install a 220v outlet in our parking space.  We proposed that we would cover the cost of installing the outlet and add a meter so the electricity could be monitored and paid for to the condo association.</p>
<p>They approved the request and upon closing on the condo I contracted with a local electrician to install the outlet and a very expensive meter so we could track the usage and pay back the association for the electricity used.  I even gave the condo president a check for $1,000 to cover the initial electricity cost.</p>
<p>The board president gave us permission and access to a locked utility closed where the electrical panels were.  My electrician installed the meter in that closet so it couldn't be tampered with by me or anyone else.  Unfortunately he also put the outlet on the same circuit as the garage gate.  This meant that the amperage for the outlet was very limited.  If I charged at more than 24 miles per hour, the circuit breaker would trip and the garage gate would no longer work.  So my hopes for a fast charger were dashed. But even at 24 mph this was sufficient since we didn't plan on driving that much, so even in 10 hours the car's battery would be full.</p>
<p>Also back in 2017 there were some other charging options around the island.  The owner of Denny's was an electric car fan, and most of his restaurants back then had chargers that worked with Tesla and other brands.</p>
<p>Eventually Tesla installed a number of superchargers on the island, so now it's not a big deal, but it is expensive to charge at those chargers.  Luckily my 2014 Model S included lifetime supercharging, so I'm set on that front.</p>
<h2>The Starting Point</h2>
<p>The apartment was a classic example of 1970s design - lots of dark wood paneling, popcorn ceilings, and a layout that felt closed off from the incredible ocean views. The previous owners had maintained it well, but it definitely needed an update to match our vision.</p>
<h2>Key Challenges</h2>
<h3>Hurricane Season</h3>
<p>We started the renovation in early 2017, which meant dealing with the uncertainty of hurricane season. Little did we know that Hurricane Maria would hit in September, adding unexpected complications to our timeline.</p>
<h3>Island Logistics</h3>
<p>Getting materials and coordinating contractors in Puerto Rico requires a different approach than mainland projects. Everything takes longer, but the local craftsmen have incredible skills and attention to detail.</p>
<h3>Preserving the Views</h3>
<p>The building's main asset is its stunning views of the Atlantic Ocean. Every design decision had to consider how to maximize these views while creating functional living spaces.</p>
<h2>Major Changes</h2>
<h3>Open Floor Plan</h3>
<p>We removed several walls to create an open concept that flows from the kitchen through the living area to the ocean-facing windows. This transformation completely changed how the space feels.</p>
<h3>Kitchen Renovation</h3>
<p>Complete gut of the galley kitchen, opening it up to the main living space. New appliances, modern cabinetry, and a layout that works for both daily cooking and entertaining.</p>
<h3>Bathroom Updates</h3>
<p>Both bathrooms got full renovations with modern fixtures, better lighting, and finishes that complement the coastal location.</p>
<h3>Flooring</h3>
<p>Replaced all the old carpeting and tile with consistent flooring throughout - something that could handle sandy feet and ocean breezes.</p>
<h2>Hurricane Maria Impact</h2>
<p>Just as we were nearing completion, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in September 2017. The building weathered the storm well, but we had to deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Water intrusion through windows</li>
<li>Power outages lasting months</li>
<li>Supply chain disruptions for finishing materials</li>
<li>Extended timeline for final completion</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<h3>Local Relationships Matter</h3>
<p>Building relationships with local contractors, suppliers, and neighbors made all the difference. The Puerto Rican construction community is tight-knit and incredibly helpful.</p>
<h3>Flexibility is Key</h3>
<p>Island time is real, and fighting it just creates stress. Building buffer time into schedules and staying flexible with timelines led to better outcomes.</p>
<h3>Quality Over Speed</h3>
<p>The local craftsmen take pride in their work and don't rush. The results speak for themselves - beautiful tile work, custom millwork, and attention to detail that you rarely see in mainland projects.</p>
<h2>Final Results</h2>
<p>The renovation transformed a dated 1970s apartment into a modern coastal retreat that maximizes the incredible location. The open layout, updated systems, and modern finishes create a space that feels connected to the ocean while providing all the comforts of contemporary living.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges - including a major hurricane mid-project - we couldn't be happier with the results. The space perfectly captures what we love about living in Puerto Rico: the connection to the ocean, the indoor-outdoor lifestyle, and the vibrant local culture.</p>
<h2>Project Details</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timeline</strong>: 8 months (extended to 12+ due to Hurricane Maria)</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong>: 1,200 sq ft, 2 bedroom/2 bathroom</li>
<li><strong>Key Features</strong>: Open floor plan, ocean views, modern kitchen, updated bathrooms</li>
<li><strong>Completion</strong>: Late 2017/Early 2018</li>
</ul>
