<p>In the late 1980s, I had the rare opportunity to write code for a <strong>Connection Machine CM-2</strong>, one of the most visually striking and conceptually ambitious supercomputers of the time. The machine was located at <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu"><strong>NCAR</strong></a> in Boulder, Colorado, and to access it, I had to drive up to the facility and sit down at a terminal hooked into one of the most powerful computing systems of the day.</p>
<p>Looking back on this I remember the feeling of doing something special.  I had to sign up for a time slot and it was in the evening (probably a weekend) when I got my time slot with the machine.  NCAR in Boulder is an imposing building up on the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.  I must admit I felt a little bit like I was approaching some villain's secret lair driving up there in the dark on a weekend.</p>

<h2>The Machine: Thinking Machines Corporation CM-2</h2>
<p>Manufactured by <strong>Thinking Machines Corporation (TMC)</strong>, the CM-2 was a massively parallel computer with up to <strong>65,536 1-bit processors</strong>. These processors were arranged in a hypercube network, enabling massive parallelism for data-intensive tasks. It was a machine originally envisioned for AI and complex simulations, but it also had a unique visual flair: its blinking red LEDs on the front face showed processor activity in real time, making it a kind of digital sculpture as well.</p>
<ul>

<li>More on TMC: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_Machines_Corporation">Wikipedia: Thinking Machines Corporation</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>The Framebuffer</h2>
<p>What made the CM-2 even more fascinating for creative work was its <strong>framebuffer system</strong>, which enabled real-time visualization of simulations and data. The framebuffer supported up to <strong>1024x1024 resolution</strong> and could output both grayscale and 24-bit color images. This was bleeding-edge for the time and gave scientists and researchers the ability to visually interpret massive parallel computations.</p>
<h2>My C* Program: Randomized Pixel Growth</h2>
<p>The CM-2 was programmed using a dialect called <strong>C</strong>* (C-star), a variant of C designed to work with SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) architectures.</p>
<p>I wrote a <strong>generative art program</strong> that created evolving pixel patterns on the framebuffer. Here's the basic idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>Random pixels were turned on initially.</li>
<li>Each frame, the program would evaluate adjacent pixels.</li>
<li>If a pixel was near an already &quot;on&quot; pixel, it had a higher chance of being turned on or having its brightness increased.</li>
<li>Over time, the image &quot;grew&quot; organically, like moss or crystal formations, creating a randomized but cohesive aesthetic.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Original C* Code (Reconstructed)</h3>
<p>Based on my memory and the C* language specification, here's what the core algorithm probably looked like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;cm/cmmd.h&gt;
#include &lt;cm/paris.h&gt;

shape [1024][1024] pixel_field;
var pixel_field: int brightness;
var pixel_field: int next_brightness;

void seed_initial_pixels() {
    // Seed random pixels across the field
    where (random() &lt; 0.001) {
        brightness = random_int(150, 255);
    }
}

void propagate_pixels() {
    // Clear next generation
    next_brightness = 0;
    
    // For each active pixel, propagate to neighbors
    where (brightness &gt; 0) {
        int rand_dir = random_int(1, 10);
        
        if (rand_dir == 9) {
            // Increase current pixel brightness
            next_brightness = min(255, brightness + 1);
        } else {
            // Propagate to neighbor based on direction
            switch(rand_dir) {
                case 1: [+1][-1] next_brightness += 1; break;  // NW
                case 2: [+0][-1] next_brightness += 1; break;  // N
                case 3: [-1][-1] next_brightness += 1; break;  // NE
                case 4: [+1][+0] next_brightness += 1; break;  // W
                case 5: [-1][+0] next_brightness += 1; break;  // E
                case 6: [+1][+1] next_brightness += 1; break;  // SW
                case 7: [+0][+1] next_brightness += 1; break;  // S
                case 8: [-1][+1] next_brightness += 1; break;  // SE
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Clamp brightness values
    next_brightness = min(255, next_brightness);
    
    // Copy to current generation
    brightness = next_brightness;
}

void render_to_framebuffer() {
    // Send pixel data to graphics framebuffer
    where (brightness &gt; 0) {
        framebuffer_pixel = RGB(brightness, brightness, brightness);
    } elsewhere {
        framebuffer_pixel = RGB(0, 0, 0);
    }
}

main() {
    CM_paris_initialize();
    
    seed_initial_pixels();
    
    for (int iteration = 0; iteration &lt; 255; iteration++) {
        propagate_pixels();
        render_to_framebuffer();
        CM_framebuffer_update();
    }
    
    CM_paris_finalize();
}
</code></pre>
<p>The beauty of C* was that operations like <code>where (brightness &gt; 0)</code> would execute in parallel across <strong>all 65,536 processors simultaneously</strong>. Each processor handled a small section of the 1024x1024 grid, making this massively parallel computation possible in the 1980s.</p>
<p>This was one of my earliest experiments with <strong>emergent behavior</strong> in code ‚Äî a concept that still fascinates me today.</p>
<h2>Modern Recreation with p5.js</h2>
<p>I've recently recreated the concept using <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, a JavaScript library for creative coding. The structure is similar: random seeds, neighbor detection, probabilistic growth. While modern hardware makes this trivial to run in a browser, the underlying idea is still rooted in that late-80s moment of discovery and exploration.</p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>
<p>Working on the CM-2 was like painting with a galaxy of blinking neurons. It was both awe-inspiring and humbling to push pixels around in parallel at a time when most people hadn't yet seen a GUI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The CM-2 didn‚Äôt just compute‚Äîit pulsed, it shimmered, it came alive.&quot; ‚Äî Me, probably</p>

<p>If you're into generative art, creative coding, or computer history, hit me up‚ÄîI'd love to hear from others who remember the CM-2 or are reimagining it in modern code.</p>
