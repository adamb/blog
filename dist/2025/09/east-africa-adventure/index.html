<p>We did a trip to Tanzania a few years ago for the Serengeti safari experience. We also explored Zanzibar and my wife and some friends climbed Kilimanjaro.</p>
<p>During that trip we were disappointed that we missed seeing the gorillas in Uganda, so this year we're back to Africa and doing more adventure travel.  Nothing as extreme as Kilimanjaro, but still some challenging adventures.</p>
<p>The main goal was to see the gorillas, but in the travel planning we decided to fly Ethiopian airlines and that gave us a stop in Addis.  We (she) started researching Ethiopia and it turns out it's a country with an amazing history and lots of interesting things to see and do.</p>
<p>First up was the gorillas.  Turns out they are in Uganda but it's easier to get there from Rwanda.  So we landed in Kigali and stayed two nights at a lovely guest house before meeting our tour.  We used <a href="https://www.standardgorillasafaris.com">Standard Safaris Ltd</a> and would recommend them.</p>
<p>Rwanda felt very safe.  It's one of the safest countries in the world according to some studies.  Of course this is the place where there was a horrible genocide back in 1994.  See Hotel Rwanda for a realistic and sad depiction of what happened.  Today Rwanda has come a long way.  Women are by law a percentage of the government and there is no longer prejudice between the tribes.</p>
<p>We did go to the memorial and also stopped for drinks at the famous hotel featured in the movie.  Both sobering experiences.</p>
<p>After our two nights catching up we met our guide Brian from Standard.  We put our bags in the trusty Landcruiser and headed to Uganda.  It was a couple hours to get to the border and then another couple hours to make it up into the mountains where the gorilla lodges are located.</p>
<p>We stayed at the beautiful but rustic Bakiga Lodge.</p>

<p>The next morning we had to get up early to head to the gorilla orientation center.  Like many things in Africa, we were welcomed with a group of people singing and dancing.  I guess that's part of the culture.</p>
<p>We were assigned a group.  There were 5 or 6 families of gorillas.  We were assigned a guide and we could request a porter for $20.  Two of us decided to get porters and it was a great idea.  They carry your backpack but also help you trek through the slippery jungle.  Each morning they send out trackers to discover where the gorilla families are located.  Those trackers radio back to the ranger/guide and he decides where to drive to so we can enter the jungle closest to the gorillas.  They warn us that it could be 2-3 hours of hiking before we get to the gorillas.  In our case we were lucky.  We came on the gorilla family after about an hour.</p>
<p>Once you get to the gorillas they take your hiking sticks so you can't threaten the gorillas and also so the gorillas don't take the sticks and attack you.  You need to wear a mask to help protect the gorillas from human diseases.  You're also supposed to stay back from them a couple meters and also not look them in the eyes so they don't percieve you as a threat.</p>
<p>We got lucky to get very close to the family including the silverback leader.  At one point we got to see the dad discipline one of the younger males.  He layed on top of him and pinned him down for a bit then rolled him over and yelled at him.  Not sure what the kid was doing, but dad put him in his place.</p>
<p>After the successful trek, we then headed through the park for a full day of driving, about 7 hours to our next hotel, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/KiPKJ96cuzhm3mnZA">Enganzi Game Lodge.</a> We went into another park and were able to see some elephants and giraffes along the way.  At sunset we saw a some sort of leopard in a tree and got a good picture.  Supposedly this park had lions that like to hang out in trees, but our guide Brian asked if any had been spotted when we entered the park.  The rangers said the lions were at the other end of the park, so we weren't able to see them this time.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/lodge-view.jpg" alt="View from our lodge in Uganda"></p>
<p>The next lodge also had a good view and nicer room.  However the wifi was worse.  Luckily I brought my Starlink Mini and it worked well.  There was much uploading of video and pictures and viewing of Instagram.</p>
<p>In the morning we went to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/JJCgTHBB2VerULrH7">Kazinga Channel</a> between Lake Edward and Lake George for a boat safari.  This was a small boat that could probably hold 15 people but we had it to our selves.  We had a female guide who spoke english and the boat captain who drove the boat.</p>
<p>We saw hippos and elephants and some eagles.  We got to see some hippos play fighting and also some elephants doing the same.</p>
<p>We saw some fishermen who the guide told us were <em>illegal fisherman</em> because it was a reserve and they weren't allowed.  Also it's dangerous and often they get eaten by hippos or crocks.</p>
<p>We didn't get to seem them get attacked or arrested, so it was a good day for them.</p>
<p>After a couple hours on the boat, we went back to the hotel for lunch.  Then to the afternoon chimp trek.  This was just maybe 40 minutes of driving so not bad.</p>
<h2>Chimpanzee Trek</h2>
<p>The chimp trek was in a much more contained area.  It's an interesting deep valley with a river running through it.</p>
<p>Again we have a little orientation and they give us walking sticks.  We drive into the park and again we are lucky, right away we spot the chimps crossing the road.  So we get out and our guide leads us just 15 minutes into the woods.   We come across a few chimps and they take our sticks away.  Chimps are much more aggressive than gorillas, they have been known to grab the sticks and hit people with them.</p>
<p>We were told that in the afternoon they wre supposed to be more sedate.  But in our case this wasn't true.  We got to see them attack some monkeys and hunt one down and kill it then eat it.</p>
<h2>Trip Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Roughly three weeks starting late August.</li>
<li><strong>Route:</strong> Kigali ‚Üí Volcanoes National Park ‚Üí Bwindi ‚Üí Addis Ababa ‚Üí Lalibela ‚Üí Nairobi ‚Üí Maasai Mara.</li>
<li><strong>Vibe:</strong> Heavy on wildlife and culture, light on downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Gear MVPs:</strong> Lightweight rain shell, binoculars, and a camera with absurd zoom.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rwanda: Kigali Calm and Mountain Gorillas</h2>
<p>Kigali surprised me with how organized and forward-looking it felt. Clean streets, polite moto taxis, and art collectives that gave a quick sense of Rwanda's creative streak. The emotional gut punch came at the Kigali Genocide Memorial‚Äîit's impossible to walk out unchanged.</p>
<p>Then it was off to Volcanoes National Park. Trekking through mist-drenched bamboo forests to sit quietly among mountain gorillas is the most intimate wildlife experience I've ever had. Our trackers kept us at a respectful distance, but the juveniles clearly hadn't read the rules‚Äîthey rolled around like toddlers showing off.</p>
<h2>Uganda: Bwindi's Impenetrable Magic</h2>
<p>Crossing into Uganda meant red dirt roads, friendly roadside stops, and more bananas than I knew existed. Bwindi Impenetrable Forest lives up to its name: thick, tangled, and intensely alive. The gorillas here felt different‚Äîmore remote, more elusive‚Äîand miraculously we also spotted a family of chimpanzees moving in synchronized chaos above us.</p>
<p>Outside the forest we visited community-run tea cooperatives and a women's craft collective. The conversations about conservation versus daily life pressures set the tone for the rest of the trip.</p>
<h2>Ethiopia: History Layered in Stone</h2>
<p>Addis Ababa hit with sensory overload: coffee ceremonies in every neighborhood, sprawling markets, and restaurants where dinner morphs into traditional dance workshops. A quick domestic hop took us to Lalibela, where the rock-hewn churches feel like time travel. Descending into the churches at dawn while priests chant is cinematic. The lack of lighting forces your eyes to adjust and suddenly the carvings pop into view.</p>
<p>I left Ethiopia with a much deeper appreciation for how ancient and continuous its history is‚Äîand with an addiction to buna.</p>
<h2>Kenya: Nairobi Hustle and Mara Drama</h2>
<p>Nairobi moved fast. Between the Karen Blixen Museum, Giraffe Centre, and a stop at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, it was a blur. The city has a tech energy that feels contagious, but the real show started once we landed in the Maasai Mara.</p>
<p>We hit the middle of the Great Migration. Wildebeest pouring over riverbanks, crocodiles waiting patiently, and a cheetah sprinting past our vehicle so fast I barely registered it in the viewfinder. Sundowners with layered skies and Maasai guides sharing stories made every evening feel surreal.</p>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logistics:</strong> Carry printed copies of key documents‚Äîborder crossings still like paper.</li>
<li><strong>Health:</strong> Yellow fever vaccine card was checked twice, and malaria prophylaxis was mandatory peace of mind.</li>
<li><strong>Cash:</strong> USD works almost everywhere, but mobile money is catching on fast in Nairobi.</li>
<li><strong>Pace:</strong> Build in a rest day. I didn't, and my legs filed a formal complaint after the gorilla treks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's Next</h2>
<p>I'm planning to expand this into a full guide with packing lists, permit advice, and recommended guides. For now, it's just a draft snapshot so I don't forget the details. Feedback on what you want to know more about is welcome!</p>
