<p>I had an incredible diving experience on the Great Barrier Reef today. The most fascinating discovery was the Giant Clam, which apparently has a lifespan similar to humans.</p>
<p>I went out with <a href="http://www.silverseries.com.au/">Silver Sonic</a>, and I highly recommend them. The crew was excellent, warning passengers about the rough winds and offering a chance to reschedule. Despite the challenging conditions, I decided to go ahead with the trip.</p>
<p>The journey was quite rough - about half the passengers got seasick. I managed by taking some ginger tablets on the way out. The return trip was even more challenging, especially after a big lunch.</p>
<p>We completed three dives, including two drift dives along the reef. Besides the giant clam, I saw:</p>
<ul>
<li>A medium-sized shark</li>
<li>A turtle</li>
<li>Numerous coral formations</li>
<li>Various fish and mollusks</li>
</ul>
<p>The divemaster was helpful, pointing out interesting marine life and occasionally letting us handle safe creatures like starfish and sea cucumbers.</p>
<p>Despite the rough seas, it was absolutely worth the experience.</p>
