# Where is the Global Entry PASS ID or Membership Number?

![Global Entry Card](/assets/global-entry-card.png)

It's on the back, in the upper left hand corner. I found this information on the [Global Entry](http://www.globalentry.gov/) site in [this PDF file](http://www.globalentry.gov/pdfs/find_ge_card.pdf).

I was just filling out my profile on [American Airlines](http://www.aa.com/), hoping that I'll get [TSA Pre](http://www.tsa.gov/tsa-precheck) check next time I fly American.
