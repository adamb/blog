# Giant Clam on the Great Barrier Reef

I had an incredible diving experience on the Great Barrier Reef today. The most fascinating discovery was the Giant Clam, which apparently has a lifespan similar to humans.

I went out with [Silver Sonic](http://www.silverseries.com.au/), and I highly recommend them. The crew was excellent, warning passengers about the rough winds and offering a chance to reschedule. Despite the challenging conditions, I decided to go ahead with the trip.

The journey was quite rough - about half the passengers got seasick. I managed by taking some ginger tablets on the way out. The return trip was even more challenging, especially after a big lunch.

We completed three dives, including two drift dives along the reef. Besides the giant clam, I saw:
- A medium-sized shark
- A turtle
- Numerous coral formations
- Various fish and mollusks

The divemaster was helpful, pointing out interesting marine life and occasionally letting us handle safe creatures like starfish and sea cucumbers.

Despite the rough seas, it was absolutely worth the experience.
